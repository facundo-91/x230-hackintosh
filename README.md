## Issues
#### WiFi:
Because Intel WiFi cards doesn't work out of the box, you have three options:
- Use a whitelisted card/macOS supported Atheros AR5B95 (Lenovo P/NÂ° 20002357) + IO80211Family.kext for 10.14 or newer.
- Flash the BIOS to remove the whitelist (using a hardware programmer or use software based [1vyrain](https://github.com/n4ru/1vyrain)) and use a Broadcom WLAN card.
- Use an USB adapter.
#### Card Reader:
Got kext to recognize it although the system freezes when you put any SD Card inside.
#### Fingerprint Reader:
My unit doesn't have it.
#### VGA Port:
Mac's doesn't have this kind of ports so you will have to use the MiniDP port with an HDMI/VGA adapter.
